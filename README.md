# Streaming-Data-Management-and-Time-Series-Analysis

This project is dedicated to test a diverse range of predictive models available for time
series analysis on R from the following categories: ARIMA, UCM and Machine Learning.
Lastly, the best forecasting model for each category is assested by the computation of their
MAE, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to interpret and compare models with each
other effectively.
